# CreateFixed
[Fabric Mod]A module that fixes the bug that the Kirin processor and Tianji processor cannot enter the Create mod.

### How to use
The usage method is very simple. Download the packaged module and throw it into your mods folder, but note that it can only be used with the files in the config folder. After putting it into the mods folder, extract the files in the config folder into the config of your integrated package. Then you can use Holy GLES to run Create mod.
